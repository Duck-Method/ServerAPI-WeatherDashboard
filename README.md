# ServerAPI-WeatherDashboard
This project uses servers and API's to call the Openweather API and render the data in the browser.

You can search a city using the search bar and the current weather is displayed for that cty.
Your history of which cities you have searched is saved underneath the search bar and when you click on one of the names, you are able to see that cities weather data again.
The red button allows you to delete the search from your history

The site is deployed at: https://serverapi-weatherdashboard.onrender.com
If enough time has passed, this example site might not currently be live at the above link.
